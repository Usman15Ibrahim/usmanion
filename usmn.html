      <h1 style="text-align:center;">The Issues Nigeria Are Facing Today</h1>
     <div style="text-align:center;">

      <p>Nigeria are among one of the most populous and wealthiest country in the world due to high population of around 215M and have alot of mineral resources like; Gold, Silver, Diamond, Uranium and others respectively.</p>
      <p> The Nigerian people have the chance to reach what it takes to reach after their independence. But because of their different tribes and cultures, that proves to be a big headache to their development. Their leader's selfishness and their (people) inability to know their right's help in disallowing their development since from their independence to date.</p> <p> This is why they are sufferring alot because they cannot tackle their issues by themselves, they always cry out on the situations while they have the right to change their problems by following alot of ways in reducing their cost of living crisis, and unability to educate their children, and others. Nigeria is a very ethnically diverse country with 371 ethnic groups, the largest of which are the Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo.</p> <p>These ethnic groups consist of multiple tribes enumerating up to 371 groups. These lots of tribes cause trials alot because of their differences in culture and religion each group fights another group. There is no peace even in the same religion and same tribe due to lack of their unity.</p>
         <p>These issues give their leaders advantage to take by using them to cause trial between each tribes and promise to bring peace and unity back among them and restore their economy, food, electricity, security, health and other things they promised to them.</p> 
          <p>Nigeria are facing alot of issues from different areas which include; insecurity, excess cost of living, lack of education, lack of electricity, lack of employment, and other issues. We are going discuss these listed issues one by one to see what kind of issues it brings in destroying us. <br>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Insecurity</h2>
 Insecurity is one of the major problems Nigeria are facing currently which is the most important issue to solve in order to bring Nigeria back on track. Security is the first thing every country must need to restore before anything else to develop itself, because without security, no economy, no agriculture (foods and animals), no shelter, no education, no electricity, no trading, because nobody can put his life in threat to plant and harvest food to eat or do some businesses to get money to provide food and shelter and even live peacefully in their own houses in a place where there is no security. That will cause alot of unemployment that will lead to hunger and this is the easiest way after insecurity to destroy the country.</p> <p>Nigeria must solve insecurity issue first to start delevoping and save it's citizen's life, because with security, it will reduce unemployment. People can go to farm, plant and harvest crops. Rearers can feed their animals with weeds by taking them to forest without feeling any fear with security. People with small businesses most especially who are buying and selling items from town to town to run their businesses can do such businesses peacefully without feeling any fear. With security, import and export will take place peacefully. With security, government workers can go to their work places and work peacefully. Peace is the first success in life. With peace you can live up your dreams.    
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Excess Cost Of Living</h2>              
  Excess cost of living is the second major problem Nigeria are facing today. If there is security in Nigeria, with excess cost of living, still they cannot develop. Because excess cost of living will torment their lives. There are 3 kind of people in Nigeria in classes of cost of living; those that can afford everything they want (including any kind of luxury thing they want), those that can only afford important thing they can e.g food, electricity, education, etc but no luxury things, and those that cannot afford everything they want (both important and luxury things). Out of 100% people of Nigeria, only less than 5% are in the first class, while 15, 20 or may be up to 25% can be in the second class, but at least 70 up to 75% are in the third class suffering alot due to high cost of living in Nigeria.</p> <p>With excess cost of living, people with small businesses cannot run their business, people cannot buy food to eat until they seek for help from people, people cannot send their children to where they will learn how to read and write. After peace, food is the second alternative to every human being. If there is cost of living, alot of people are going to live like animals. Because their only target is to find food to eat, they will not think about developing their lives by growing their businesses, educate themselves and their children, pay bills to enjoy electricity and buy other luxury things. </p> <p>This is where cost of living is contributing in destroying contries development most especially African countries. Low level Government workers (employees) will be paid small salaries, people with small capitals are unable to run their businesses due to excess cost of living and they will use their small capital since they are unable to capitalize their business to buy food and finish the remaining capital they have. Little by little they will not have money to buy food to eat. Other unemployed people have already turn to beggers because they don't have jobs to get money to buy food to eat. The civilians/poor people are the ones that are suffering this issue. While the Politicians, most especially the ones in administration like; President, Senators, Governors and others with high salaries are not facing this challenge. Why?</p><p>Because the government will take care of their needs and pay them with a very high salary while the civilians will not have that favour. <br>The Government will not reduce cost of items both important and non-important items and it will not pay them with high salaries. People eat food to live. Without food, how can Nigerians develop their country?</p>
       <p>The country have to reduce it's properties cost by reducing the petrol price, standardize agriculture by protecting the farmlands from wastage by giving the farmers security to go and cultivate crops, standardize security, helping weak people by giving them enough money to run their businesses safely, allowing import and export in the country, giving the youth alot of job opportunities to avoid unemployment and other contributions.
       <h2 style="text-align:center">Lack of Education</h2>  
Lack of education means the same thing as unstandard or low level of education. It is one of the major issues affecting Nigerian development. Before, Nigerian education is well standardized due to equality between each person's children. Poor children can study together with leaders children. Beside that, there are enough facilities and equipments to teach the younger ones. Mostly that time, Western people who are very well professions and experienced are the ones who guide our parents. As time goes on, little by little, level of our country's education started to loose foundation. Nigerian education has been affected by different problems which are; Lack of professionalism from the employees, Lack of equipments to guide the students, Lack of interest from professional mentors, Excess private schools, Lack of offering job opportunities to the qualified employees.<br> There are alot of problems affecting Nigerian education, but we only list few problems and we are going to discuss them one by one.</p>        
     <p style="text-align: center"><b>Lack Of Professionalism From The Employees;</b></p>
     <p>Alot of guardians (teachers/lecturers) in Nigeria don't have professionalism about what they taught/teach. This gives problem in disallowing their younger ones to be understand what they teach. We can also call it as lack of experience from the mentors. Some guardians can be affected with the issue of unavailable equipment to guide the students, while some, even with the equipments cannot guide the students because of their unprofessionalism in the field.</p>
     <p style="text-align: center"><b>Lack Of Equipments To Help The Students Understand More;</b><br></p>
     <p>This is of course one of the biggest issue that have alot of effect in disallowing western education growth.This is another reason that brings disadvantage to the destruction of our growth. It has relation with lack of professionalism, because alot of guardians cannot help their students without some equipments, while some can try even without the equipments, but with teaching equipment they could help them understand better.</p>
     <p style="text-align:center"><b>Lack Of Interest From Professional Mentors</b></p>
     <p>Most of Nigerian workers have turned from nationalists to those who love money because of excess cost of living and hunger. It affect their interest from guiding their younger ones for bright future. Because they work for only money instead of what will help their nation grow and develop. That is one of the reason alot of professional workers doesn't want government work or anything regarding teaching/lecturing work because of low salary with high demand of day to day living.That is why alot of civilians loose have interest in teaching/lecturing most especially civilians of high-level profession of education like Engineers and others.</p>
     <p style="text-align:center"><b>Excess Private Schools</b></p>
     <p>Private schools affected public schools in different areas. Before, public schools are the only schools in Nigeria. There is nothing like private schools in Nigeria. Gradually, due to the selfishness of our leaders to differentiate themselves against the people they rule, they plan to let public schools loose it's foundation and seize this opportunity to build their own schools to take away their children from studying together with poor children.</p>
<p>They provide enough equipments for the employees to use them educate their children, instead of renovating public schools, they use the government money to build their own schools. While leaving other children struggling with unavailable teaching aids/equipments.</p>
<p style="text-align:center";><b>Lack of offering job opportunities to the qualified employees</b></p>
<p>Corruption is one of the biggest trial destroying countries development, most especially in a place where the nation need to build itself best. Standard education is one of the place where nation needs to develop best, but surprisingly facing challenge in terms of job opportunities due to the problem of selling offers. Some qualified civilians who are professional on teaching field are unemployed due to the issue of selling job offers, unless you have enough money to buy the offer. Some are employed but are unprofessional due to their lack experience on teaching. This issue really cost not only western education, but also religious education that people study in western education.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Lack of Electricity</h2>
<p>Lack of electricity is one of the major and common issues Nigeria has. Issues of electricity is one of the earliest issues Nigeria faces since from it's independent. Though, from it's early independence, things are better than today not only regarding electricity issue, but everything they own. As time goes on, things started to get worse. Development began to disappear, every hope fades away. At the end, the country itself sold it's own properties (electricity & other properties). Issues of electricity causes alot of destruction to the country, more especially to us (poor people). People with small businesses who cannot run their business without electricity suffer this issue most. People who cannot afford petrol due to it's high expenses like barbers, grinders, small companies that works with electricity and other occupations that can only run through the use of electricity.</p>
<p>Issues of electricity don't only affect our businesses and occupations, it even affect our day to day living which includes; our security, our education, our food and other things that will help our development either directly or indirectly. Regarding security, lack of electricity affect us during night time. If there is no light, it will create room for criminals to commit crimes. While regarding education, it affect us mostly after our secondary level. Tertiary students are suffering against lack of electricity regarding their school update, task they need to solve using their phones and other things they need to use with electricity. Regarding our foods, it affects us (poors mostly). People that cannot afford expensive foods will use the little money they get to buy grains. If they buy those grains they can't eat it like that, they will take it to grinders in order to grind those grains for them to use it to let them live. Our current electricity issue is the worst I've ever seen in Nigeria under this worst administration. Sadly, it affect Arewa people most. Who suffers poverty most in Nigeria. Some people may end up not eating anything that day because of this issue. We need electricity more than how we are getting it currently.
<h2 style="text-align:center">Lack of Employment</h2>
<p>In our current day to days living situation, high unemployment rate contribute alot in disrupting our lives and our development. Unemployment causes insecurity, due to the fact that unemployed people  has no source of getting money to feed themselves. They will try to get money at all cost. That moment, when they are suffering against hunger, they will attempt to get an occupation whether legal or illegal in order to feed themselves. Lack of employment in a country causes country's economic collapse, If government doesn't provide subsidy to help unemployed civilians from idleness, their idleness could not affect only their source of income (unemployed people), but even government income in some cases, regarding their occupation, government will get income from different ways that can be from receiving tax from them and other ways of generating revenue from their efforts of building their lives. Employment prevent committing crimes, because most of those that commit crimes, they commit them because they don't get money to feed themselves. Mostly, this is the primary reason they commit crimes.</p>
